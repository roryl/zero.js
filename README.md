Zero.js - Instant Ajax Applications
Using zero.js, build ajax rich, progressively enhanced web applications, using server side rendering and no additional javascript. Zero.js makes building web applications fun again!

##What Zero.js Does
Zero.js enhances native HTML 5 forms and anchor links by intercepting certain POSTs and GETs, and dynamically updating the expected changed elements on the page, all without using push-state or breaking native browser URls and history functionality. It preserves traditional server side URL routing while giving a smooth ajax experience.

##When to use it
Use Zero.js for applications that are server-side routed and rendered. Zero.js allows you to keep the stability, security and flexibility of a server side stack while having the user experience of a java script client rendered application. Zero.js works with any existing server side rendered application and does not require your server app to be aware of the client side view concerns (no needs to server side template partials or fragments).
